# Ethernaut

This project containts in the `contracts` section all the challenges of [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) by Openzeppelin.

I copied all the contracts and added a "Hack" contract that contains the solution of the challenge (when a smart contract is required). What I did and I recommend is to copie/past both the challenge contract and it solution in remix and play around with them to understand how it works.
